# AnalysingHouseprices_using R Programming

# Task
The Purpose of this project is to first study and analyse what has been the trend in the selling price of houses in Cincinnati area by looking at the data collected from websites - Zillow and Trulia. Next is creating a model based on selected features which could predict the selling price of houses that come up for sale in the future with high degree of accuracy.

# Quick Summary of Final Model 
We have built 2 models, one using a bigger dataset with less number of covariates, and other small dataset with additional variables, because we have sparse dataset. The plan is to average the two models to arrive at the final prediction.
